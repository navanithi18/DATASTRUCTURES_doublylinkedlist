This repository focuses on the implementation of a **Doubly Linked List (DLL)** in Java, supporting various essential operations. Unlike a **Singly Linked List**, each node in a **Doubly Linked List** contains three components: `data`, a `prev` pointer linking to the previous node, and a `next` pointer linking to the next node. This bidirectional structure allows for more efficient insertions, deletions, and traversals in both forward and backward directions.  

The repository includes key operations such as **insertion** (at the beginning, end, or a specific position), **deletion** (from the start, end, or a particular node), **traversal** (forward and backward display), and **searching** (finding specific elements or the middle node). Advanced functionalities like **reversing the list** and **detecting loops** are also implemented. The **doubly linked list** is particularly useful in scenarios where efficient two-way traversal is required, such as in undo/redo functionality and navigation systems.  

This project is designed for learners and developers looking to understand and implement **Doubly Linked Lists** effectively. The code is well-structured and easy to follow, making it suitable for both beginners and experienced programmers. Users can **clone, modify, and contribute** by optimizing existing methods or adding new features. Contributions are welcome to enhance the efficiency and functionality of the repository.
